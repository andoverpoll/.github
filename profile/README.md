## The Nation’s First
The Phillips Academy Poll is the nation’s first high-school-run public opinion poll. 

Founded in 2021, The Phillips Academy Poll, also informally known as Andover Poll, Phillips Poll, and Phillips Academy Polling, conducts surveys of voters across America and rigorously analyzes the data in order to present a clearer picture of the status of these races. The surveys are primarily conducted over the phone and the data is weighted so it more accurately reflects the views of the electorate.

The Phillips Academy Poll’s mission is to provide accurate, independent, and non-partisan data and analysis regarding voter sentiment relating to key elections.

## Based at Phillips Academy
The Phillips Academy Poll is based at Phillips Academy and is run by Phillips Academy students and faculty.

Founded in 1778, Phillips Academy is an independent co-educational university-preparatory school for boarding and day students located in Andover, Massachusetts. Phillips Academy’s alumni include President George H.W. Bush, President George W. Bush, Governor Jeb Bush, John F. Kennedy Jr., Congresswoman Katie Porter, and Congressman Seth Moulton. Phillips Academy offers 300 courses taught by 211 faculty members and boasts a 5:1 student-faculty ratio.

The Phillips Academy Poll is made possible by a grant from the Abbot Academy Fund, continuing Abbot’s tradition of boldness, innovation, and caring. Abbot Academy was an all-girls boarding school located right down the street from Phillips Academy, operating from 1829 until 1973, when it merged with the all-boys Phillips Academy. After the merger, Abbot Academy’s endowment became the basis of the Abbot Academy Association, which funds exceptional projects that further with Abbot values and benefit the Phillips Academy community.
